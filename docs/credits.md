# Credits and Licence

## Credits
Most contents of this site do not come from me and this site is merely a  collection of extraordinary content from great authors all over the web. Thank you for making your content freely accessible. I try to credit authors directly in documents, where their content is used. Nevertheless I want to thank a few people explicitly, because they may have provided content or just because they have been an inspiration for me (and they might be as well for the reader of this):

- Stefan
- Hans
- Albrecht
- Trude

## Layout
The layout of this site is based on the free and open-source Jekyll-Theme [Just The Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs){:target="_blank"}. You can see Just The Docs in its original form [here](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/){:target="_blank"}.

## Licence
Everything on this Website that is not credited to an author is open. If credited, the respective authors licence applies. If you use any open content from this site, feel free to so. But please, if you develop/advance/improve the content used, [let me know](mailto:brain@hohn.li), because I might be interested in updating my content based on what you did.
